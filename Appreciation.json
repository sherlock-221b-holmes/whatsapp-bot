Babe how to tell you I miss you, I tell it to myself by just not trying to miss you but live the moments I lived with you in my beautiful peace of mind where you stay"

            "name": "Anything can exist in the world but the fact that you are my home, one of my own. Babe, after my mother and father the most I have loved and cared about is you, we only have a relationship that confines us to some conventions set by the world and society... but you, my dear, my lovely lady, the eyes deep like ocean, the skin smooth like cool breeze, the touch exotic like the feeling of touching a bed of aromatic flowers, my darling you are mine by heart by soul"
